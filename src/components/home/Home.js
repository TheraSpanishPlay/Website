                        forward to every lesson as they are play-based. I remember once, three years
                        ago, we were in Switzerland and my daughter talked to a waiter in English. He  
                        didn’t understand, so she switched to Spanish and he understood! I’m so proud
                        of her and so happy that we have chosen Ms. Ileana.”

                        I was afraid I would be unable to cope with weekly classes. However, Ileana’s
                        professional approach, with each lesson tailored to the student’s individual
                        needs and development, has ensured my steady progress and nurtured my love for
